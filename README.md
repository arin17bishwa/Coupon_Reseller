# Coupon_Reseller
A trial website design to resell the meal coupons of our college.

This project is designed to let students of NIT Durgapur post ads for selling their unused meal coupons.

To make sure every user is actually a student of the college, registering with institute email address is necessary. Their email ID will be verified by a autogenerated verification email sent to their mail ID.

Once registered, they will be asked to make a profile,without which they can neither post anything, nor view others' profiles.

The a SQLite file containing the Registration No. and corresponding names of the students(currently, only those of UG program) has been prepared in the account directory. If the user registration number exists in the database then their "Name" field in their profile will be autofilledand be immutable by the user. They will  also be marked Verified.The links to their profiles will be shown in green, while the other accounts will be coloured red.

Every user has the ability to edit post ad after posting it.

A demo has been put up at http://arin17.pythonanywhere.com/
